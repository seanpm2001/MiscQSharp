# Solving Sudoku using Grover's Algorithm

This project shows how to add resources estimation step to [this sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/03cb2f2a4daff0e231bf88f22be8e445e5e09c9f/samples/algorithms/sudoku-grover), and how to optimize the solution based on the results.

For the details, see ["Analyzing a Sudoku solver using resources estimation" blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/analyzing-sudoku-solver-using-resources-estimation/).

The code has been tested only with 4x4 Sudoku puzzles.
